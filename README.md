#simplewebapp1
1. This is a simple Python based web application that I created with the help of Github copilot.
2. When you open the web page for first time it displays a message "Welcome to my Web app!". Below this message it has a empty text box where you can input your name.
3. Once you enter your name and hit submit it then redirects to another web page and displays the message "Hello, $name! This is a simple web application using Flask."
4. This is a beginner level Python project which is really simplistic in design, it only needs 3 files to deploy.
   a. The Python app file with the python code - app.py
   b. The HTML file called - hello.html
   c. The HTML file called - home.html
Important thing to remember here is - both html files must be inside the "templates" directory otherwise the page will throw errors.
Also, app.py and templates directory should be inside the same directory.
5. As of now this code only works on my localhost port 5000 i.e. http://127.0.0.1:5000
6. The components you need to run this application are as below:
   a. Python - I am using Python version 3.10.5
   b. Flask - version 3.0.1
   c. HTML
   d. VScode - code editor of choice.
7. Special tanks to Github copilot - the one who actually provided the code that i could play around with.

Go forward plan:

1. Upload the code to guthub - DONE
2. Dockerize this app and publish the container code -DONE
3. Make this application avialable online through any free web host - TBD
4. Explain the code line by line and upload to guthub - TBD
